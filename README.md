# palm-oil-hyperspectral-monitoring
This project utilizes deep learning in remote sensing to detect Ganoderma fungi. With hyperspectral imaging, neural networks analyze spectral data to identify infected areas accurately. By merging deep learning with remote sensing, it promises early detection and intervention to mitigate agricultural losses.
